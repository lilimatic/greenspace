-- Methodology --
-----------------

The empirical study is contains 3 parts. In the premilinary stage, we analyse the descriptive structure of the data with tabular summaries (frequencies, cross-tables) and graphical plots. 

In the second stage, we analyse the dependency structure between features by testing for dependence between selected features of interest with χ2-tests.

In the final step, a machine learning prediction task questioning the safety in a public space during the pandemics is performed.

-- Data description --
----------------------

This survey consists of 13 questions answered by n= 400 participants. The question catalogue is listed in the appendix. Split by gender, 67.5 % of the participants are female and 32.5 % are male. The average respondent roughly 35 years old. Precisely, most attendants are between 25-40 years old (39.8 %). Younger participants, aged 24 years or less, form 29.2 % of the population. The remaining 31.0 % are participants between 41-64 years of age. The demographic structure is summarized in Table x and Table y.

-- Descriptive Statistics --

1. Park visit preferences

Survey participants were asked about their pre-pandemic and current park visiting habits. In addition, they were asked if their park visit habits changed by the occurance of the pandemic. 

Table 3 (How much time do you usually spend in parks or squares since the corona virus outbreak in Serbia?)

Table 4 (How often have you visited parks or squares in 2019 during the day?)

Table 5 (Regarding the parks or squares that you have visited in 2019, did you visit parks or squares more frequently during the day before the corona virus outbreak?)

Table 3 to Table 5 summarize the park visit related information. During the pandemic a large proportion of the population (68.3 %) prefers to spent up to 1 hour in the park, while 20.2 % prefer longer visits. In pre-pandemic 2019, nearly half of the participants (49.5 %) visited parks at least a few times per week. In comparison to pre-pandemic visits, 64.7 % claim to visit parks as least as frequently as before the pandemic. Among these, 40.5 % increased thir visits. 

In a nutshell, frequency and duration of park visits reveil that most participants are frequent park visitors. This of course verifies the representativeness of the sample.

2. Munipalities 

Participants were ask to list several municipalities of parks and squares visited. Commonly visited parks are located in Novi Beograd (17.3 %), Vračar (14.9 %), Stari grad (14.4 %), Palilula (12.7 %) and Zemun (11.6 %). Details are provided in Table x.

3. Activity 

Participants were asked about their social activity during part visits ("When visiting parks or squares you are often with x people or y pets ?"). Multiple choices were permitted. 

Table 7 (When visiting parks or squares you are often)

The information is summarized in Table 7. The results show that park visits are often considered as social gatherings. The majority (73.5 %) prefers to spent the park visit other people, either with another person (35.6 %), groups of friends (31.1 %) or children (6.8 %). The remaining third (26.5 %) chooses to visit the park by themselves or with a pet. By reason of social distancing during the pandemic, it is reasonable that meetings in larger groups were less popular (5.4 %). 

4. App

Lastly, participants are asked about their interest in the app, location-sharing preferences and about enhancements in subjective physical and Covid-related safety the app could provide. The results are summarized in Table 7 and Table 8.

Table 7 (Interest, Physical safety, Covid safety)

Table 8 (If your identity was not revealed, would you want to provide your phone’s location (see question 10)?)

Most survey participants (64.2 %) are interested in the App. For the usage of the app, 57.0 % are anonymously willing to share their location. One aim of the app is to provide different perceptions of safety. Park monitoring would provide the feeling of physical safety to 54.2 % of the participants. COVID-related safety would be felt by 56.2 % of the participants.

-- Independence tests --
------------------------

The inferential statistical analysis looks for independence among selected features. Given a 5 % confidence level, we test for independence between interest in this new technology and the subjective feeling of safety (physical, SARS-COVID2 related), 
location sharing, demographical aspects (age, gender) and time spent in a public space, respectively. 

We question independence between interest in the app and time spent in public spaces (Qa vs Qb; Qc; Qd). Table 9 to Table 11 display the contigency tables and Table 12 to Table 14 the Chi-square tests tables, respectively. 

The tests indicate dependence between interest in the app and time spent in the public spaces pre-pandemic (p < 0.1 %) and frequency of park visits during the pandemic (p < 0.1 %), respectively. On a 5% confidence level, we cannot reject the independence hypothesis between interest in app technology and pandemic-related increased frequency of park visits (P=10,56%). 

Indepence is additionally tested between location sharing and interest in the app (Qx vs Qb; Qc; Qd). Table 15 to Table 17 display the contigency tables and Table 18 to Table 20 the Chi-square tests tables, respectively. 

We observe similar results to the previous case: the results indicate dependence between location sharing and pre-pandemic time spent in parks (p < 5 %) or frequency of park visits (p < 5 %), respectively, while we cannot reject independence between location sharing and pandemic-related increased frequency of park visits (P=87,95%).
